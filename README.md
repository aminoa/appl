# appl

This is an unofficial python API wrapper that provides access to the events and organizations on the NYU campus, allowing other NYU students to build applications that want to integrate this data. 

This currently pulls event data, organizations, and news from NYU Engage. I eventually plan on adding more options when calling get events to filter events based on branch or category. I don't have plans to support log in features (such as signing up for events) or filling forms.
